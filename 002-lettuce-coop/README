trying to change window title text from another geiser process

have coop-repl-server up and running

c code calls scheme routine get-title

so thought if i redefine get-title
(define (get-title) "my new title")

possibly need to look get-title up again , reset it so if it gets
redefined i get the latest version perhaps
